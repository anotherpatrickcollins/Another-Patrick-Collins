      <h3>Heeb, Germany Issue<br/></h3>
      <p>Even though the Jews control all of the media in the US, it still takes a lot of balls to publish a magazine called <a href="http://www.heebmagazine.com/" target="_blank"><em>Heeb</em></a> and basically straight take the piss out of your own religious
        culture. Thankfully, these nu-Jews are totally into that, and because they're already in the tribe, they have the security of not getting blacklisted and financially executed like an Irish-catholic twenty-something copy-writer. Eeek!<br/><br/>The
        current issue is <em>Heeb </em>#21, The Germany Issue where the Heebsters take on the intertwined history and contemporary attitude of Jews in Germany. It's packed with hilarious and terrible features like Roseanne Barr dressed as Hitler burning
        Jew cookies, the winning entry of their fake holocaust memoir contest (written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Biller" target="_blank">Maxim  Biller</a>!), and porn jewess Joanna Angel comparing and reviewing how German sausages
        fit into her various orifices. Eat your heart out, <em>Vice</em>.</p>
      <br/><br/>

      <h3>Meteor Impact Crators<br/></h3>
      <p>Let's talk about astroblemes for a second. Yeah, astroblemes man. Or shatter cones? How about shock-metamorphic effects, cryptoexplosion, or hypervelocity impact? Come on y'all, it's meteor impact crater time! Whether they have their own <a href="http://awurl.com/oc3Vq3IHb"
          target="_blank">radio station</a> or are the destination of a classic Aussie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2313290009/" target="_blank">horror  movie</a>, impact sites are the fucking jam.<br/><br/>According to the <a href="http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/"
          target="_blank">Earth Impact  Database</a>, there are 170 confirmed sites around the globe. Twenty-six of those are in Australia, including a giant 90km diameter one in SA. While a 90km wide crater sounds great, it's a bit too large to take in
        all at once, so going for a 1 to 5km crater is the best bet unless you're in space or have a plane. <br/><br/>Now, if you're a lazy son of a bitch and can't be bothered to leave the city for this, you can check out 50 craters from outer space
        thanks to our good buddies Google and <a href="http://geology.com/meteor-impact-craters.shtml" target="_blank">Geology.com</a>. But if you actually want to stand on the rim of an epic natural wonder and blast Aerosmith to relive <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo_0UXRY_rY"
          target="_blank">1998</a> to the fullest, we'd suggest actually hiking up a crater and making out with Liv Tyler after her dad dies. Perfect.<br/></p>
      <br/><br/>

      <h3>Shine Shoe Shine<br/></h3>
      <p>Having an obsession with feet is not usually a socially acceptable thing. Sure, there are websites, foot models, sock outlets...but most people just don't share your enthusiasm for tootsies. We say 'most people' because there are still places where
        you freaks can fit in. <a href="http://www.shineshoeshine.com.au/" target="_blank">Shine  Shoe Shine</a> is one of these places. The people of SSS really care about how your feet look. Maybe even too much.<br/><br/>Shine Shoe Shine has passion
        above and beyond what you'd expect from a shoe shiner. Everything they do is extraordinary: they give bulk discounts when you bring in your entire collection of custom made boots, they offer a free pickup/delivery service for those of us who can
        go shoeless in the office for an afternoon, and they have collected more than 65 colour-matching shines to make those blood-red heels look like they just stepped out of that poor boy's heart. Again</p>
      <br/><br/>

      <h3>WeSC  Bongo Headphones, Ed Banger edition<br/></h3>
      <p>Oh Sweden. The land of dreams, beautiful <a href="http://expressnightout.com/content/photos/2007-10-25-jens2-435.jpg" target="_blank">men</a> and <a href="http://www.thefader.com/ys_assets/0005/4559/lykkeout_main.jpg" target="_blank">women</a>,
        and flat pack furniture. You know, I hear that everything we like from Sweden is better over there. <a href="http://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank">Ikea</a> give you real tools, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/suburbankidswithbiblicalnames" target="_blank">Suburban  Kids With Biblical Names</a>        actually have a shorter name, and the meatballs taste the same even though they're vegetarian.<br/>
        <br/>Sweden is also home to company called <a href="http://www.wesc.com/" target="_blank">We are the  Superlative Conspiracy</a> who make street fashion and have rad <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALjLl9tPiU" target="_blank">advertisements</a>,
        even if we're not convinced they know exactly what their name means. They have extended their reach to make some very stylish headphones, and have partnered up with Parisian heavyweight label <a href="http://www.edbangerrecords.com/" target="_blank">Ed Banger</a>        to deliver the newest edition.<br/><br/>You're probably wondering now why a clothing company would partner up with a record label to make headphones. Obviously, it would be better if they combined forces with say, a headphone company, but that
        would be too logical and probably produce something way less fashionable. So yeah, a record label and clothing company doesn't make any sense, but it does produce some great looking headphones that don't make you feel like a total nerd when they
        are sitting atop your dome.</p>
